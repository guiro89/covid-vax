# Project Title: Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination on Mortality in the United States

## Description
This project determines the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality in the United States. Using a publicly available dataset, we analyze the impact of vaccination on deaths attributed to COVID-19 from January 2020 to September 2023.

The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging the `pandas` library for data handling and `matplotlib` for plotting. Additionally, Google's `CausalImpact` package is used to conduct a Bayesian structural time-series analysis, which allows us to estimate the causal effect of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign on mortality rates.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `causalimpact`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib causalimpact
   ```
3. Run the script to generate the analysis and plots.

## Features
- Analysis of COVID-19 mortality trends before and after vaccine introduction.
- Causal impact analysis using Bayesian structural time-series modeling to estimate the effect of vaccination on mortality rates.
